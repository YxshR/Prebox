# Security Monitoring Error Recovery Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive error recovery mechanisms to the security monitoring system, ensuring graceful degradation when security monitoring fails and providing alternative logging mechanisms as fallback.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Graceful Degradation
- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically detects when multiple security components fail
- **Reduced Frequency**: Health checks are reduced from 30 seconds to 2 minutes during degradation
- **Graceful Fallback**: System continues operating with reduced functionality rather than complete failure
- **Recovery Detection**: Automatically exits degradation mode when components recover

### 2. Alternative Logging Mechanisms
- **Primary Logging**: Winston-based file and console logging
- **Alternative File Logging**: Emergency directory with separate log files
- **Console Fallback**: Direct console logging when file systems fail
- **Memory Logging**: In-memory storage for critical events (last 100 entries)
- **System Logging**: Platform-specific system log integration (Linux/macOS)

### 3. Security Monitoring System Failure Alerts
- **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Email, webhook, and Slack notifications
- **Severity-Based Routing**: Different alert channels based on failure severity
- **Fallback Alert Methods**: Multiple alert delivery mechanisms with failover
- **Emergency Email Alerts**: Direct SMTP alerts for critical failures
- **Recovery Notifications**: Alerts when systems recover successfully

### 4. Enhanced Error Recovery
- **Automatic Recovery**: Up to 3 automatic recovery attempts per component
- **Exponential Backoff**: 5-second delays between recovery attempts
- **Component-Specific Recovery**: Tailored recovery methods for each system component
- **Manual Recovery Triggers**: Admin endpoints for manual recovery initiation
- **Recovery Success Tracking**: Monitoring and logging of recovery attempts

## Components Enhanced

### ResilientSecurityMonitorService
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of all security components
- **Recovery Management**: Automated recovery attempt coordination
- **Graceful Degradation**: Intelligent system degradation and recovery
- **Alert Integration**: Comprehensive alerting for system failures

### FallbackLoggerService
- **Multi-Method Logging**: Multiple logging mechanisms with automatic failover
- **Health Checking**: Self-monitoring and recovery capabilities
- **Log Export**: Manual log export for administrative review
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log file rotation and archiving

## API Endpoints Added

### Health and Status
- `GET /api/security/health` - Get security monitoring health status
- `GET /api/security/fallback-logger/status` - Get fallback logger status

### Recovery Management
- `POST /api/security/recover` - Trigger manual system recovery
- `POST /api/security/fallback-logger/recover` - Trigger fallback logger recovery

### Graceful Degradation Control
- `POST /api/security/graceful-degradation/enable` - Enable degradation mode
- `POST /api/security/graceful-degradation/disable` - Disable degradation mode

## Error Recovery Flow

1. **Detection**: Health checks identify component failures
2. **Assessment**: System determines if graceful degradation is needed
3. **Degradation**: If needed, system enters reduced functionality mode
4. **Recovery Attempts**: Automatic recovery attempts with exponential backoff
5. **Alerting**: Notifications sent through multiple channels
6. **Fallback Logging**: Alternative logging mechanisms activated
7. **Manual Intervention**: Admin endpoints available for manual recovery
8. **Recovery**: System automatically exits degradation when components recover

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `SECURITY_ALERT_EMAIL` - Email address for security alerts
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` - SMTP configuration
- `ALERT_FROM_EMAIL` - From address for alert emails

### Alert Channels
- **Email**: SMTP-based email alerts
- **Webhook**: HTTP webhook notifications
- **Slack**: Slack webhook integration
- **Console**: Direct console output for critical issues

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Status Tracking
- Database connection health
- Redis connection health
- Audit logging system health
- Threat detection system health
- Alerting system health
- Overall system health

### Fallback Logging Metrics
- Primary logger health status
- Alternative logger availability
- Log file sizes and rotation status
- Recent log entries for debugging

### Recovery Metrics
- Recovery attempt counts per component
- Success/failure rates for recovery attempts
- Time to recovery for each component
- Manual vs automatic recovery statistics

## Security Considerations

- **Fail-Safe Design**: System fails to a secure state
- **Audit Trail**: All recovery attempts are logged
- **Access Control**: Recovery endpoints require SUPER_ADMIN privileges
- **Alert Security**: Sensitive information filtered from alerts
- **Log Protection**: Fallback logs stored in protected directories

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for all recovery mechanisms
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Health check validation tests
- Fallback logging functionality tests

### Manual Testing
- Verification script for end-to-end testing
- Component failure simulation
- Recovery mechanism validation
- Alert delivery testing
