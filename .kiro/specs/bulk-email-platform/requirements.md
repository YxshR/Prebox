# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive bulk email platform that enables users to send promotional and transactional emails through a multi-tier SaaS service. The platform will support three distinct user tiers (Free, Paid Standard, Paid Premium) with varying levels of functionality, custom domain support, and API integration capabilities. The system will be built as a full-stack application with separate frontend (Next.js), backend (Node.js/Python/Rust), and admin interfaces, featuring modern dashboard analytics with graphs and animations.
