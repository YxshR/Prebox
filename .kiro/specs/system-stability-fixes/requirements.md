# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The system is experiencing critical stability issues affecting user experience across multiple areas: frontend HTTP 400/network errors, missing Google authentication, security monitoring failures, pricing validation problems, AI feature connectivity issues, and improper environment file handling in version control. This spec addresses comprehensive system stabilization to ensure reliable operation across all components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend application to connect reliably to the backend API, so that I can register, login, and use all features without encountering HTTP 400 or network errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to register THEN the system SHALL successfully process the request without HTTP 400 errors
2. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the circuit breaker SHALL not remain permanently open
3. WHEN network connectivity is available THEN the retry mechanism SHALL successfully recover from temporary failures
4. WHEN the backend is running THEN the frontend health checks SHALL return successful responses
5. IF the API client encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see Google authentication options on both signup and login pages, so that I can easily authenticate using my Google account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the signup page THEN the system SHALL display Google authentication button
2. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display Google authentication button
3. WHEN a user clicks Google authentication THEN the system SHALL initiate proper OAuth flow
4. WHEN Google authentication completes THEN the system SHALL properly handle the callback and create/authenticate the user
5. IF Google authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the security monitoring system to function properly without errors, so that I can track and respond to security events effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security monitor runs THEN the system SHALL not generate error logs
2. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL properly log and track them
3. WHEN accessing security monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display accurate data
4. IF security monitoring detects issues THEN the system SHALL alert administrators appropriately
5. WHEN security monitoring starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all required components successfully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see accurate pricing information with proper server-side validation, so that I can make informed decisions about service plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views pricing pages THEN the system SHALL display server-validated pricing information
2. WHEN pricing data is requested THEN the system SHALL fetch current prices from the backend
3. WHEN pricing validation occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and accuracy
4. IF pricing data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback messaging
5. WHEN pricing changes THEN the system SHALL update displays in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI features to work reliably with proper internet connectivity handling, so that I can use AI-powered functionality without encountering connection errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI features are accessed THEN the system SHALL verify internet connectivity before processing
2. WHEN internet connection is available THEN AI features SHALL function normally
3. WHEN internet connection is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display clear messaging about connectivity requirements
4. IF AI API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and retry options
5. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN AI features SHALL automatically resume normal operation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment files to be properly excluded from version control, so that sensitive configuration data remains secure and deployment configurations are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed to Git THEN .env files SHALL not be included in the repository
2. WHEN .env.example files are updated THEN they SHALL be included in version control as templates
3. WHEN developers clone the repository THEN they SHALL have clear guidance on environment setup
4. IF sensitive data exists in .env files THEN the system SHALL prevent accidental commits
5. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use appropriate environment-specific configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all three applications (frontend, backend, admin-frontend) to start and run without errors, so that the entire system operates reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL initialize all services without errors
2. WHEN the frontend starts THEN it SHALL connect to the backend successfully
3. WHEN the admin-frontend starts THEN it SHALL function independently without errors
4. IF any application encounters startup errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
5. WHEN all applications are running THEN they SHALL maintain stable inter-service communication
