# Authentication System Rebuild Requirements

## Introduction

The current authentication system has multiple critical issues that require a complete rebuild. Users cannot signup, the multi-step signup process is broken, login methods are not working, and pricing data is not being fetched from the database. This document outlines the requirements to rebuild the authentication system with proper multi-step signup flows and multiple login methods.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Step Phone Number Signup Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want to signup using my phone number through a 3-step process, so that I can create an account with phone verification, email verification, and password creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts phone signup THEN the system SHALL display step 1 with phone number input
2. WHEN a user enters a phone number THEN the system SHALL check if it already exists in the database
3. IF the phone number already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent signup and display an error message
4. WHEN a user enters a valid unique phone number THEN the system SHALL send an OTP via SMS and store the verification attempt in the database
5. WHEN a user enters the correct OTP THEN the system SHALL update the database and proceed to step 2 (email verification)
6. WHEN a user enters an incorrect OTP THEN the system SHALL allow retry without blocking the user
7. WHEN a user completes phone verification THEN the system SHALL display step 2 with email input
8. WHEN a user enters an email THEN the system SHALL check if it already exists in the database
9. IF the email already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent signup and display an error message
10. WHEN a user enters a valid unique email THEN the system SHALL send an email verification code and store it in the database
11. WHEN a user verifies the email THEN the system SHALL update the database and proceed to step 3 (password creation)
12. WHEN a user creates a password THEN the system SHALL complete the signup, store all user data in the database, and create the user account
13. WHEN signup is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically log in the user and store the session in the database

### Requirement 2: Auth0 Signup Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want to signup using Auth0 and then verify my phone number, so that I can quickly create an account using social authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses Auth0 signup THEN the system SHALL redirect to Auth0 authentication
2. WHEN Auth0 authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL check if the email already exists in the database
3. IF the Auth0 email already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate signup and redirect to login
4. WHEN Auth0 authentication is new THEN the system SHALL store the Auth0 profile data in the database and proceed to step 2 (phone verification)
5. WHEN a user enters their phone number THEN the system SHALL check if it already exists in the database
6. IF the phone number already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent signup and display an error message
7. WHEN a user enters a valid unique phone number THEN the system SHALL send an OTP via SMS and store the verification in the database
8. WHEN a user verifies the phone number THEN the system SHALL update the database and complete the signup process
9. WHEN Auth0 signup is complete THEN the system SHALL create the complete user account with Auth0 profile data stored in the database

### Requirement 3: Multiple Login Methods

**User Story:** As a user, I want to login using Auth0, phone number with OTP, or email and password, so that I can access my account using my preferred method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses Auth0 login THEN the system SHALL authenticate via Auth0, verify the user exists in the database, and log in the user
2. WHEN a user chooses phone login THEN the system SHALL verify the phone number exists in the database and send an OTP
3. WHEN a user enters the correct OTP THEN the system SHALL verify against the database and log in the user
4. WHEN a user chooses email/password login THEN the system SHALL validate credentials against the database and log in the user
5. WHEN any login method succeeds THEN the system SHALL return JWT tokens, create a session record in the database, and update last login timestamp
6. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt in the database and provide specific error messages for each method
7. WHEN a user attempts login with non-existent credentials THEN the system SHALL check the database and return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4: Database Schema Recreation and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to recreate the database schema to support the new authentication flows with unique constraints, so that all user data and verification states are properly stored and users cannot create duplicate accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is recreated THEN the system SHALL create tables for users, phone verifications, email verifications, and Auth0 profiles with unique constraints
2. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL store all verification states, user data, and authentication methods in the database
3. WHEN verification steps are completed THEN the system SHALL update the user's verification status in the database
4. WHEN a user attempts to signup with an existing phone number THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate registration and return an error
5. WHEN a user attempts to signup with an existing email THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate registration and return an error
6. WHEN pricing data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure it can be fetched by the frontend from the database
7. WHEN any authentication data is created THEN the system SHALL store it permanently in the database with proper indexing

### Requirement 5: Pricing Data Integration and Database Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see pricing information on the main page and website, so that I can understand the available plans and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main page loads THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch pricing data from the database without errors
2. WHEN pricing API is called THEN the system SHALL return complete plan information with features, prices, and limits from the database
3. WHEN pricing data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display fallback pricing information and log the database error
4. WHEN pricing data is updated in the database THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately on the frontend
5. WHEN the pricing endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper database connection and query execution
6. WHEN pricing tables are missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL recreate them with proper schema and seed data
7. WHEN frontend requests pricing THEN backend SHALL handle CORS and authentication properly for pricing endpoints
8. WHEN pricing data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure all pricing plans, features, and limits are properly indexed in the database

### Requirement 6: Frontend and Backend Integration with Database Persistence

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between frontend and backend for all authentication flows with complete database persistence, so that users have a smooth experience across all signup and login methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend makes authentication requests THEN backend SHALL handle all signup and login flows properly with database validation
2. WHEN backend sends responses THEN frontend SHALL handle success and error states appropriately, including duplicate account errors
3. WHEN multi-step flows are in progress THEN frontend SHALL maintain state between steps and backend SHALL store progress in the database
4. WHEN verification codes are sent THEN both frontend and backend SHALL handle the verification process with database tracking
5. WHEN authentication completes THEN frontend SHALL store tokens, backend SHALL update database records, and redirect users appropriately
6. WHEN errors occur THEN both systems SHALL provide clear error messages including database constraint violations and recovery options
7. WHEN duplicate signup attempts are made THEN frontend SHALL display specific messages about existing phone numbers or emails
8. WHEN database operations fail THEN both systems SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide user-friendly messages
### Re
quirement 7: Critical Pricing System Fix

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to fix the pricing system that is currently not loading, so that users can see pricing information and make purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pricing system is diagnosed THEN the system SHALL identify why prices are not loading from the database
2. WHEN pricing database tables are checked THEN the system SHALL verify table structure, data integrity, and proper indexing
3. WHEN pricing API endpoints are tested THEN the system SHALL ensure they return proper JSON responses with all pricing data
4. WHEN pricing queries are executed THEN the system SHALL optimize database queries for fast loading times
5. WHEN pricing data is missing THEN the system SHALL recreate pricing tables with complete plan information
6. WHEN frontend calls pricing endpoints THEN the system SHALL ensure proper API routing and response handling
7. WHEN pricing system is fixed THEN the system SHALL display all pricing plans on the main page and website
8. WHEN pricing data loads THEN the system SHALL cache pricing information for improved performance
